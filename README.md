# 9CardPageFormatter
This takes playing card images and outputs printer paper sized templates with up to 9 card images for fast formatting

This is meant to take a folder that has images (normally at 745px,1040px) and takes 9 at a time and formats it onto a printer paper sized image for printing. This version takes 9 different card images and formats them for easy proxy printing. This version only includes a single copy of each card. I have made another version that takes an image of a single card and formats 9 copies of that image onto a printer paper sized image

I designed this for Magic the gathering cards, and I designed it to work with cards provided by scryfall.com
I also made another project that takes a txt file with a decklist in the format of "# name",l and it downloads all of the images from Scryfall.com automatically into a single folder


Notes:

I designed this for a 300 pixels per inch printer, and I am not sure if or how that will impact other qualities or printers
